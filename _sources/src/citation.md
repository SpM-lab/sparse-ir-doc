# Citation

If you has used `sparse-ir` in your research, and you would like to acknowledge the project in your academic publication, please use the following:

```
We used the sparse-ir library~\cite{wallerberger2023} based on the intermediate representation~\cite{shinaoka2017} and the sparse sampling~\cite{li2020}.
```

The bibtex entries are the following:
