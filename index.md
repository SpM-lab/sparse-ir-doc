# Welcome to sparse-ir documentation

This document describes the sparse-ir ecosystem including the following libraries:
- [sparse-ir](https://github.com/SpM-lab/sparse-ir-rs): Rust crate with C-API and Fortran bindings
- [sparse-ir](https://github.com/SpM-lab/sparse-ir): Python library
- [SparseIR.jl](https://github.com/SpM-lab/SparseIR.jl): Julia library

We describe the basis knowledge of the intermediate representation.

For the Python and Julia libraries, we provide comprehensive tutorials in the [sparse-ir-tutorial](https://spm-lab.github.io/sparse-ir-tutorial) tutorial website.
For detailed usage of the libraries and their API, please refer to the documentation and test codes of each library.
